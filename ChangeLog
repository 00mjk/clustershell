1.1 rc1
	* clush.py: added '=' special command in interactive mode to toggle
	output format
	* Engine/Engine.h: register writer fd even if set_writer_eof() has
	been called.
	* Worker/EngineClient.h: don't close writer when woef is True when
	some data remains in write buf.
	* NodeSet.py: fixed a NodeSet.__contains__() issue, sometimes it did
	not match (only when padding was used), eg. "node113" in
	"node[030,113]" didn't work.
	* clush.py: added workaround to replace raw_input() which is not
	interruptible in Python 2.3
1.1 beta6 [Wed Jul 8 2009]
	* clush.py: major improvements (added write support, better interactive
	mode with readline, launch task in separate thread to let the main thread
	blocking tty input, added Enter key press support during run, added node
	groups support (-a and -g) using external commands defined in clush.conf,
	added --copy toggle to clush to copy files to the cluster nodes, added -q
	option, added progress indicator when clush is called with gather option
	-b)
	* doc: added man pages for clush and nodeset commands
	* clush.vim: added vim syntax files for clush.conf
	* Engine.py: added write support to workers
	* Worker: created a base class WorkerSimple()

1.1 beta5 - LUG'09 live update
	* update last_node so that user can call worker.last_node() in an ev_timeout handler callback
	* update clush.py script with new 1.1 changes (thanks to Aurelien)

1.1 beta4
	* bug fix in timers when invalidated two times

1.1 beta3
	* bugs fix in timers
	* added EngineTimer.is_valid() method to check if a timer is still valid
	* added optional `match_keys' parameter in Task and Worker iter_buffers() and iter_retcodes() methods

1.1 beta2
	* added Worker.did_timeout() method to check if a worker has timed out (useful for Popen2 workers, other use DistantWorker.num_timeout()).

1.1 beta1
	* added NodeSet.clear() and RangeSet.clear() methods
	* added workaround to allow NodeSet to be propertly pickled (+inf floating number pickle bug with python 2.4)
	* bug fix : don't keep a reference on internel RangeSet when creating a NodeSet from another one

1.1 beta0
	* new Ssh-based engine's worker, with fanout support, thus removing ClusterShell mandatory pdsh dependency
	* timer/repeater support
	* some internal design changes
